# StructInsight_in_Python
Structural analysis of continuous beams with intuitive input.
This is essentially a translation of project 'https://github.com/khirwadkar/StructInsight' from 
Java to Python programming language. Of course, some improvements have been made; notably, use of 
'numpy' library for more efficient matrix operations.
